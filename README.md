# Tesla & Ferrari Stock Price Prediction
Welcome to the Tesla & Ferrari Stock Price Prediction project! This repository contains Python code and machine learning models designed to predict the stock prices of Tesla and Ferrari based on historical data. Whether you are a finance enthusiast, a data scientist, or simply curious about stock market predictions, this project provides a comprehensive guide and implementation.

### Key Features:
- **Data Collection:** Explore the Jupyter notebooks that detail the process of collecting historical stock price data for both Tesla and Ferrari. Understand the importance of clean, reliable data for training accurate prediction models.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Delve into the exploratory data analysis notebooks to gain insights into the stock price trends, correlations, and any other relevant patterns. Visualization techniques are employed to make the data more interpretable.
- **Feature Engineering:** Learn about the features selected for predicting stock prices and the reasoning behind their inclusion. Feature engineering is a crucial step in enhancing the model's predictive capabilities.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Discover the machine learning models implemented for stock price prediction. This repository includes models such as linear regression, support vector machines, and possibly more advanced techniques like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or long short-term memory networks (LSTMs).
- **Model Evaluation:** Understand how the models are evaluated, including metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), or others. Evaluate the performance of each model and gain insights into their strengths and limitations.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Explore any hyperparameter tuning techniques applied to optimize the model's performance. This section provides an opportunity to fine-tune the models for better predictions.
- **Predictions and Results:** Check out the predictions made by the models on test data and compare them with the actual stock prices. Understand the accuracy and reliability of the predictions.
- **Dependencies and Installation:** Find clear instructions on the dependencies required to run the code successfully. Create a virtual environment and install the necessary packages for a seamless experience.
